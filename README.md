# DeepLearning-Assignments (WIP)

<div style="text-align: justify"> Just a small tutorial project I wrote for learning the basics of OOP and Tensorflow/Keras in Python. 
The first file is just a simple two layered CNN for recognizing hand written digts from the MNIST data set. The second 
file is a variational autoencoder to generate new data based on the MNIST data set. </div>
